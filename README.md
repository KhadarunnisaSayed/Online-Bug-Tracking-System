# Online Bug Tracking System

The **Online Bug Tracking System** is a web-based application developed using **Java, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL** to automate the process of bug reporting, assignment, tracking, and resolution. The system is designed to improve **software quality, team collaboration, and workflow transparency** by providing a structured approach to bug management.

## Project Overview
In software development, bugs or errors can significantly impact functionality, performance, and user experience. Manual bug tracking becomes inefficient and error-prone as applications grow complex. This system streamlines the process of **reporting, assigning, monitoring, and resolving bugs** in a systematic and organized manner.

The application implements **role-based access control** for three main roles:
- **Manager:** Activates and manages developers, oversees overall workflow.
- **Team Leader:** Assigns bugs to developers and monitors progress.
- **Developer:** Updates bug status until resolution, maintaining real-time progress logs.

All bug data is stored in a **centralized MySQL database**, and the system maintains a **history log** for each bug to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Key Features
- Automated bug reporting, assignment, tracking, and resolution  
- Role-based workflow management  
- Centralized database with detailed bug history and status logs  
- Improved team collaboration and communication

## How to Run
1. Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**  
2. Configure the **Apache Tomcat Server**  
3. Import the MySQL database from the `database/` folder  
4. Run the project
